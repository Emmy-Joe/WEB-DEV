            The commandments of God frequently come in collision with the lifestyle of man. Many times, a man finds himself doing what he knows is not right. He agrees with the text of the law, but contradicts the law in practice. Such an individual is under the bondage of sin. The redemption we have in Christ provides a total solution to the problem of sin. Forgiveness and cleansing from sin is not the end of Christ‟s sacrifice; there is also exaltation unto holy living. Conversion to Christ sets us free from the dominion of sin. Having been saved by grace, we are expected to walk in newness of life.

              <p class="mb-4"> Romans 7:7-24.</p>
                <p>
                  <p>Sin is a power that brings the sinner under dominion. The power of sin is not realised until man wakes up to the demands of the law (Rom. 7:7-11). While the soul is still in darkness (i.e. without the law), man‟s depravity is not very evident to him. But when the light of the law shines on his conscience, the ugliness of his heart overpowers his soul. Some proud, ignorant sinners boast in their self-righteousness, because they do not know the depravity of their soul. They are wilfully ignorant of the commandments of God. Sin is an active, domineering principle in every sinner, whether he is awakened to its reality or not (Rom. 7:7,9; Judges 17:7). Sin is a killer.</p>
                  It perverts the commandments of God and works death through them (Rom. 7:9-13). Sin enslaves man. Indwelling sin controls the sinner and makes him act contrary to his desire to do good. The will may be positive, but the flesh is ruled by the power of sin. Therefore, the sinner persists in the undesirable evil, rather than the desirable good. His religion is struggle and frustration (Rom. 7:14-24). The law of God emphasises the desires of the Spirit, while sin accentuates the lusts of the flesh. As the two are contrary, the sinner, awakened to the demands of the law, despairs of his depraved state, and is condemned by the law.

                  <li id="p2"> <b>THE POVERTY OF THE SINNER</b>
                    <p>
                      Man is helpless when it comes to atonement for sin: he is incapable of providing a solution to his problem of sin or change his eternal destiny (Psalm 49:6-9; Jeremiah 13:23). The nature of sin is not such that man could handle on his own or by the merit of his good works (Ephesians 2:8,9). God‟s standard is high; man lacks both the capacity and the purity demanded to meet it. Just as circumcision cannot justify the Jew, nor water baptism the Gentile, even so can Church membership or “confirmation” not suffice to justify any man (Galatians 2:15,16; Titus 3:3-5). The sinner must be “born-again” (John 3:3).

                    <li id="p3"> <b>REDEMPTION THROUGH CHRIST’S SACRIFICE</b>
                        <p>
                        The sinner is saved on the basis of Christ‟s atoning death on the Cross of Calvary. Jesus is “the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world” - John 1:29. Christ became our sin bearer, God‟s Provision and man‟s Advocate and Propitiation for sin (Romans 3:24,25; Acts 4:12; I John 2:2). By Christ‟s finished work of grace, a sufficient and permanent solution was provided for the problem of sin to ensure man‟s reconciliation with God (Isaiah 44:22,23; 53:5,6,10; Romans 5:6-10; 8:3,4; Hebrews 9:11-14). We are redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus (Ephesians 1:7; Col 1:12-14).

                    <li id="p4"> <b>JUSTIFICATION THROUGH FAITH</b>
                        <p>
                        Although Christ‟s atonement on the Cross guarantees universal provision of salvation for all mankind, it can only be received on a personal basis through saving faith. The sinner who seeks salvation must take the necessary step of faith in the blood of Jesus. When the sinner hears the word of salvation, he must allow it to mix with faith in him, and then he must personally respond to that faith, putting it to work by resting on what Jesus has already done (Hebrews 4:2; Romans 10:6-13; Ephesians 2:8,9; Acts 16:29-34).

                    <li id="p5"> <b>EVIDENCE OF GRACE</b>
                      <p>
                        Having been saved through faith in the Lord Jesus, the redeemed has evidence in his new life to show for his justification (II Corinthians 5:17). The saved person is to be a follower of God, to walk like Jesus in love (Ephesians 5:1,2). Before he was justified, the sinner had works of the flesh as catalogued in Galatians 5:19-21. But as a new creature, the fruit of the Spirit is manifest in him (Galatians 5:22,23). In lifestyle, speech, conduct and disposition, the redeemed is more like Christ, having been quickened by the Spirit of God (Ephesians 4:17-24; I John 2:6).
