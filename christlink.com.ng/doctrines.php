            <h3>THE HOLY BIBLE</h3>
            <p>That the Holy Bible, consisting of 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of 
              the New Testament, is the inspired Word of God. We take the Bible as final authority 
              in all matters concerning Christian conduct and work.
              (2 Timothy 3:16,17; Proverbs 30:5,6; Revelation 22:18,19.)</p>

            <h3>THE GODHEAD</h3>
            <p>That the Godhead consists of three separate, distinct, and recognisable personalities and qualities, perfectly 
              united in one. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are different Persons in the Godhead, not merely three 
              names for one Person.
              (Matthew 3:16,17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Matthew 28:19,20.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>REPENTANCE</h3>
            <p>That Repentance is a complete turning away from all sins and its deceitful pleasures and that it is 
              required from every sinner before he can truly and effectively believe in Jesus with saving faith.
              (Proverbs 28:13; Isaiah 55:7; Ezekiel 18:21-23; Mark 1:15; Luke 24:46,47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 20:20,21; 
              2 Corinthians 7:10; Hebrews 6:1-3.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</h3>
            <p>That the Second Coming of Christ will be just as literal and visible as His going away, and He is coming
               to execute judgement upon the ungodly. He will also, then, set up His Kingdom and reign on this present 
               earth for a thousand years.
              (Zechariah 14:3,4; Matthew 25:31-46; 26:64; Mark 13:24-37; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; 2:8; Jude 14,15.)

          <div>
            <h3>THE RAPTURE</h3>
            <p>That the Rapture (commonly referred to as the first phase or stage of the SECOND COMING OF CHRIST) is 
              the catching away from the earth, of all living saints and all who died in the Lord. The Rapture will 
              take place before the Great Tribulation and can happen any time from now. “In a twinkling of an eye” 
              without a moment’s warning, “the trumpet shall sound” . . .</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE GREAT TRIBULATION</h3>
            <p>That the Great Tribulation will occur after the Rapture and will be a time of terrible suffering on 
              earth. It is also referred to as the time of “Jacob’s trouble”. During this time, the Antichrist will 
              take possession of this world for a reign of terror. (Matthew 24:21,22,29; Revelation 9:16; Mark 13:19; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; Revelation 13. 
              Daniel 8:23-25; 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12; Revelation 13:1-10. Revelation 19:1-10.) . . .

          <div>
            <h3>CHRIST’S MILLENNIAL REIGN</h3>
            <p>That Christ’s Millennial Reign is the 1,000 years literal reign of Jesus on earth, 
              which will be ushered in by the coming of Jesus back to earth with ten thousands of His
               saints. At this time He will judge the nations that dwell upon the face of the earth. 
               During this time, the devil will be bound. It will be a reign of peace and blessing.
              (Jude 14,15; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10. Revelation 20:2,3. Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:25; Hosea 2:18; 
              Zechariah 14:9-20; Isaiah 2:2-4.) . . .</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE GREAT WHITE THRONE JUDGEMENT</h3>
            <p>That the Great White Throne Judgement is when God finally judges all (the living and the dead, small and great)
               who have ever lived on the face of the earth, according to their works. This is after the Millennium. 
              (John 5:24; 3:17-19. Daniel 12:2,3; Matthew 10:15; 11:21-24,12:41,42; John 5:28,29; Romans 2:15,16; 14:12; 
              2 Peter 2:9; Jude 6; I Corinthians 6:1-4; Acts 10:42; Revelation 20:11-15.) . . .</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH</h3>
            <p>That the New Heaven and the New Earth “wherein dwelleth righteousness” will be made by God and the
               redeemed shall dwell therein with God forever. This present earth which has been polluted by sin will 
               pass away after the Great White Throne Judgement. No unclean thing will be there.
              (Psalm 102:25,26; Isaiah 51:6; 65:17; Matthew 5:18; 24:35; 2 Peter 3:10-13; Revelation 21:1- Isaiah 66:22;
               2 Peter 3:12,13; I Corinthians 13:12; I John 3:2,3; Revelation 21:1-7; 22:1-5.) . . .</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD</h3>
            <p>That the Resurrection of the dead is taught in the Bible as clearly as the immortality of the soul. 
              Every individual who has ever lived will be resurrected, some to honour and glory and others to everlasting 
              shame and contempt.
              (Job 19:25-27; Psalm 71:20; Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2; John 5:28,29; I Corinthians 15:12-57; 
              I Thessalonians 4:13-16; Hebrews 6:1,2; Philippians 3:8-11; Revelation 20:4,6,12,13.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE FALL OF MAN AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h3>
            <p>The subject of sin is of great importance in every religion. In fact, most religious rites are direct consequences of sin. The Christian faith came because of sin. The Bible is the book of sin. The Gospel is the message of sin. Christian ministry is predominantly because of sin. Hell is a consequence of sin. Sin is the transgression of God‟s law. It is the sum total of all unrighteousness. Deliverance from sin is the great object of God‟s redemptive plan. . .</p>

          <div>
            <h3>CHRIST – MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND MAN</h3>
            <p>In our previous study, we saw the fall of man and its consequences. The greatest consequence of a life of sin is eternal damnation. God is holy; He is eternally opposed to sin. As God cannot have fellowship with the sinner on earth, so is the sinner eternally banned from His presence in heaven. It is therefore of necessity that a solution must be found for the problem of sin. From the very onset of man's fall, sacrifice for sin commenced.</p>

            <h3>THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF JESUS</h3>
            <p>The virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten Son of God as well as His crucifixion, death, burial and
               bodily resurrection.
              (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25; Romans 1:4; I Corinthians 15:3,4.)</p>

            <h3>TOTAL DEPRAVITY, SINFULNESS AND GUILT OF ALL MEN</h3>
            <p>The total depravity, sinfulness and guilt of all men since the Fall, rendering them subject to God’s wrath and condemnation.
              (Psalm 51:5; Job 14:4; Romans 3:23; 5:12-17; Mark 7:21-23; Ephesians 2:1.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>WATER BAPTISM</h3>
            <p>That water Baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with God. Water Baptism is one immersion (not three) “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”, as Jesus commanded.
              (Matthew 28:19; 3:13-17; Mark 16:15,16; Acts 2:38;8:38,39; 19:1-5; Romans 6:4,5.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>THE LORD’S SUPPER</h3>
            <p>That the Lord’s supper was instituted by Jesus Christ so that all believers (all members of the 
              family of God) might partake thereof regularly, to “shew the Lord’s death till he come”. The emblems 
              used are “unleavened bread” and the juice of “fruit of the vine”. Anyone who eats and drinks unworthily brings “damnation”, punishment and chastisement upon himself.
              (Matthew 26:29; Luke 22:17-20; I Corinthians 11:23-30.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>ENTIRE SANCTIFICATION</h3>
            <p>That Entire Sanctification is a definite act of God’s grace, subsequent to the New Birth, by 
              which the believer’s heart is purified and made holy. It cannot be attained progressively by works, 
              struggle or suppression, but it is obtained by faith in the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ. Holiness of 
              life and purity of heart are central to Christian living.
              (Luke 1:74,75; John 17:15-17; I Thessalonians 4:3,7,8; 5:22-24; Ephesians 5:25-27; Hebrews 2:11; 10:10,14; 
              13:11,12; Titus 2:11-14; I John 1:7; Hebrews 12:14; I Peter 1:14-16.)</p>

          <div>
            <h3>HOLY GHOST BAPTISM</h3>
            <p>That the Baptism in the Holy Ghost is the enduement of power from on High upon the sanctified believer. 
              It is “the promise of the Father” and when one receives this “gift of the Holy Ghost”, it is accompanied by the
               initial evidence of speaking a language unlearned previously, referred to as speaking in tongues as the Spirit
                gives utterance.
              (Matthew 3:11; Acts 1:8; Luke 3:16; 24:49; John 1:30-33; 7:37-39; 14:16,17,26; 15:26; 16:12-15; Acts 1:5-8; Mark 16:17; Acts 2:1-18; 10:44-46; Acts 19:1-6; I Corinthians 12:1-31; 14:1-40.) . . .

            <h3>REDEMPTION, HEALING AND HEALTH</h3>
            <p>That Redemption from the curse of the law, Healing of sickness and disease as well as continued Health 
              are provided for all people through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.
              (Exodus 15:26; Deuteronomy 7:15; Psalm 103:1-5; Proverbs 4:20-22; Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:16,17;

            <h3>PERSONAL EVANGELISM</h3>
            <p>That Personal Evangelism is a God-given and God-ordained ministry for every believer. Jesus commanded 
              and God requires every believer to be a compassionate and fruitful soulwinner, bringing others to Christ.
              (Matthew 28:19,20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49; John 17:18; Acts 1:8; 1-4; Psalm 126:5,6; Proverbs 11:30;

            <h3>MARRIAGE</h3>
            <p>That Marriage is binding for life. Monogamy is the uniform teaching of the Bible. Polygamy is contrary 
              to God’s perfect will and institution . . .
              (Genesis 2:24; Deuteronomy 7:1-4; Job 23:11-13; 2 Corinthians 6:14-18; Proverbs 31:10-31; Malachi 2:14,15; Romans 7:2,3; Ephesians 5:31-33; Matthew 5;31,32; 19:3-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18; John 4:15-19; Genesis 20:3-7.)</p>

            <h3>THE FALL OF MAN AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h3>
            <p>The subject of sin is of great importance in every religion. In fact, most religious rites are direct consequences of sin. The Christian faith came because of sin. The Bible is the book of sin. The Gospel is the message of sin. Christian ministry is predominantly because of sin. Hell is a consequence of sin. Sin is the transgression of God‟s law. It is the sum total of all unrighteousness. Deliverance from sin is the great object of God‟s redemptive plan. It is therefore necessary for every believer to understand the subject of sin and God‟s provision for its remedy.</p>

            <h3>THE DESTINY OF SINNERS</h3>
            <p>God’s Word teaches that hell fire is a place of everlasting punishment where sinners (all who do not have their names in the book of life) will suffer torments for ever and ever. It was prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41) but God has decreed that the wicked and those who forget Him and reject Christ will also be cast there because of their sin and neglect of His salvation (Psalm 9:17; Matthew 25:46; Luke 12:4,5; Matthew 5;22,30; Mark 9:43-47, Revelation 14:10,11; 20:10,12-15).</p>
