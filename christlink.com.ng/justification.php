            <p class="mb-4"> <b>Acts 17:30</b> <br>
                <i>God’s Word teaches that Justification (or Regeneration) is the act of God’s grace whereby one receives forgiveness and remission of sins, and is counted righteous before God, through faith in the atoning blood of Jesus, standing before God as though he had never sinned (Psalm 32:1,2; Isaiah 1:18; Micah 7:19; John 3:3-8; Acts 13:38,39; Romans 3:24-30; 4:6-16; 5:1,2; II Corinthians 5:17-21; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 2:8,9; Titus 3:5; I Peter 1:23.</i> <br>
                Justification is God‟s act through which a sinner receives forgiveness and remission of sins, and is counted righteous before God on the merit of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. Having thus been cleared of every guilt of sin, the regenerated soul stands before God as if he had never sinned (Psalm 32:1,2; Isaiah 1:18; Micah 7:19; Acts 13:38).

              <li id="p1"> <b>THE CONSEQUENCE OF SIN</b>
                <p>
                  Sin separates man from God. Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Though they were still physically in the garden before judgment came, they were spiritually dead, being separated from God (Genesis 2:16,17; 3:1-3,6-10). “The soul that sinneth, it shall die” - Ezekiel 18:4. The separation that sin brings between man and God is not only in time, but also in eternity, if there is no repentance (Luke 13:24-27; Revelation 20:11-15; 21:8,27).  
                </p>

                  <li id="p2"> <b>THE POVERTY OF THE SINNER</b>
                    <p>
                      Man is helpless when it comes to atonement for sin: he is incapable of providing a solution to his problem of sin or change his eternal destiny (Psalm 49:6-9; Jeremiah 13:23). The nature of sin is not such that man could handle on his own or by the merit of his good works (Ephesians 2:8,9). God‟s standard is high; man lacks both the capacity and the purity demanded to meet it. Just as circumcision cannot justify the Jew, nor water baptism the Gentile, even so can Church membership or “confirmation” not suffice to justify any man (Galatians 2:15,16; Titus 3:3-5). The sinner must be “born-again” (John 3:3).

                    <li id="p3"> <b>REDEMPTION THROUGH CHRIST’S SACRIFICE</b>
                        <p>
                        The sinner is saved on the basis of Christ‟s atoning death on the Cross of Calvary. Jesus is “the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world” - John 1:29. Christ became our sin bearer, God‟s Provision and man‟s Advocate and Propitiation for sin (Romans 3:24,25; Acts 4:12; I John 2:2). By Christ‟s finished work of grace, a sufficient and permanent solution was provided for the problem of sin to ensure man‟s reconciliation with God (Isaiah 44:22,23; 53:5,6,10; Romans 5:6-10; 8:3,4; Hebrews 9:11-14). We are redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus (Ephesians 1:7; Col 1:12-14).

                    <li id="p4"> <b>JUSTIFICATION THROUGH FAITH</b>
                        <p>
                        Although Christ‟s atonement on the Cross guarantees universal provision of salvation for all mankind, it can only be received on a personal basis through saving faith. The sinner who seeks salvation must take the necessary step of faith in the blood of Jesus. When the sinner hears the word of salvation, he must allow it to mix with faith in him, and then he must personally respond to that faith, putting it to work by resting on what Jesus has already done (Hebrews 4:2; Romans 10:6-13; Ephesians 2:8,9; Acts 16:29-34).
                        </p>

                    <li id="p5"> <b>EVIDENCE OF GRACE</b>
                      <p>
                        Having been saved through faith in the Lord Jesus, the redeemed has evidence in his new life to show for his justification (II Corinthians 5:17). The saved person is to be a follower of God, to walk like Jesus in love (Ephesians 5:1,2). Before he was justified, the sinner had works of the flesh as catalogued in Galatians 5:19-21. But as a new creature, the fruit of the Spirit is manifest in him (Galatians 5:22,23). In lifestyle, speech, conduct and disposition, the redeemed is more like Christ, having been quickened by the Spirit of God (Ephesians 4:17-24; I John 2:6).
