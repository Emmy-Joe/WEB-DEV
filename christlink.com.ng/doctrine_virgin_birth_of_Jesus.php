            <h2 class="text-primary">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="mb-4"> <b>Isaiah 7:14</b> <br>
                <i>God’s Word teaches the virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten Son of God. It equally teaches the crucifixion, death, burial and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25; Romans 1:4; I Corinthians 15:3,4.</i> <br>
                The doctrine of the “virgin birth” teaches that Jesus, the only begotten Son of God, was miraculously conceived by the Virgin Mary. The virgin birth is an essential doctrinal truth which must be upheld for its fact and significance. Disputing this cardinal doctrine is by implication denying Christ‟s deity and His distinctive nature as the only sinless man, conceived without adamic depravity. It was this distinctive spotlessness that disqualifies every other man from satisfying God‟s demand at Calvary. Jesus became the spotless Lamb of God found in fashion as a man.

              <li id="p1"> <b>THE FULFILLED PROPHECY Isaiah 7:14.</b>
                <p>
                Prophetically, the virgin birth was foretold in the Old Testament, and it became literally fulfilled later in the New Testament (Genesis 3:15; Isaiah 7:14; Mat 1:20-23). God was the first to unveil the virgin birth of Christ, when He referred to Him as “the seed of the woman” (Genesis 3:15). This was alluding to the fact that Christ would be conceived by a woman who had never known a man. The prophet Isaiah in his proclamation said, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son . . .” (Isaiah 7:14). The word virgin as used in this reference, has an obvious meaning, and can be nothing else but a woman who has not known a man. And according to the faithfulness of God, the prophecy came to pass after many years (of God‟s appointment). God will always keep His promise (Matthew 1:18-25; Psalm 89:34).

                  <li id="p2"> <b>PROOFS OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH Matthew 1:20</b>
                    <p>
                    Luke in his gospel narrative recorded that the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin, betrothed to a man, and the virgin‟s name was Mary (Luke 1:26,27). After the announcement, Mary herself plainly said, “How shall these things be, seeing I know not a man?” (Luke 1:34). Matthew in his gospel, narrated that Mary was espoused to Joseph, and that before they came together, she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 1:18). He further recorded that Joseph knew her not till she had
                    <br> brought forth her firstborn Son, and he called his name Jesus. The Bible says that Joseph was a just man (Matthew 1:19). This means he was not a transgressor of God‟s law. If Mary as an espoused virgin had conceived through a strange man, it would then be right for Joseph to put her away (Deuteronomy 22:23,24; Matthew 19:9). But the angel of God who appeared to Joseph in a dream prevented him from putting her away, for what was conceived of her was of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 1:20). On the other hand, if Joseph had known Mary before Christ was conceived, or was responsible for the conception, it would be unlawful for him to even attempt to put her away (Mal. 2:14-16). The scriptures would not have qualified him to be a just man if he was transgressing God‟s commandment. <br>

                    <li id="p3"> <b>THE UNIQUENESS OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH Isaiah 7:14.</b>
                        <p>
                        The virgin birth of Jesus was a unique sign from God. The prophet Isaiah was very clear and definite about it (Isaiah 7:14). It distinguished Him from any other man, and marked Him as the only true Messiah. God bears witness to His approved ministers in various ways. Some of the signs that were recorded concerning Christ and His ministry were also recorded concerning a few other messengers of God. The virgin birth, however, is probably the most unique and unprecedented sign. A voice from the cloud witnessed to the ministry of Christ. But that was not as unique as the virgin birth, for Moses‟ ministry was also attested to by a voice (Num. 12:5-8; Matthew 17:5). An angel announced the conception of Christ; but we also know the births of Samson and John the Baptist were equally announced by angels (Judges 13:2-5; Luke 1:11-15,26-33). Moses, Samson and John the Baptist, were all God‟s messengers, but they all had earthly fathers. They were all descendants of Adam‟s fallen race. The virgin birth is therefore a unique sign from the Lord, conferred on Christ, and He alone. No other living soul has ever been, or will ever be conceived of a virgin. <br>
                        The challenge is for us to come near in reverence and worship. It is in our believing the Word of God in its totality that we shall be established (Isaiah 7:9).
