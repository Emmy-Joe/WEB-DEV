                <i> God’s Word teaches that the Holy Bible, consisting of 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New Testament, is the inspired Word of God. We take the Bible as final authority in all matters concerning Christian conduct and work (II Timothy 3:16,17; Proverbs 30:5,6; Revelation 22:18,19). </i>

              <li> <b>FACTS ABOUT THE BIBLE</b>
                <p>
                The Holy Bible is the inspired Word of God, and it is the only source of knowledge of the Almighty God to all mankind. It is the contact point between finite man and the infinite God, and its purpose is to give mankind a revelation of God (II Timothy 3:15-17). The Bible is severally referred to as the Holy Scriptures (Romans 1:2; II Timothy 3:15), the Oracles of God (Romans 3:2; Hebrews 5:12), the Book of the Lord (Isaiah 34:16), the Book of the law (Jos. 1:8), the Word of God (Mark 7:13), the Word of Christ (Colossians 3:16), and the Word of Life (Philippians 2:16). It comprises two parts: the Old and the New Testaments. It has 66 books, 39 of which are in the Old, while 27 are in the New Testament. The Bible was originally written in Hebrew and Greek. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew and Aramaic, and the New in Greek. There were over 40 authors drawn from disparate generations spanning a period of over 1800 years, used by God to write the Bible. And even though their occupation, education and social classes were divergent, their theme was the same as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost (II Peter 1:20). The inspiration of the authors can be attested to by some peculiar characteristics of the Bible, which are not found in any other book written by man. Such characteristics include its wonderful unity despite the fact that the authors lived at different ages, its versatility as it meets the needs of all people irrespective of race and language (Matthew 4:4), its superiority to other books, its influence on individuals and nations, its preservation over the centuries, its fulfilled prophecies (Isaiah 7:14; Ezekiel 36:19; II Chronicles 7:19), and its perfection (Psalm 19:7; James 1:25). <br>
                The pre-eminence of the Bible makes it indispensable to all men today (Isaiah 40:8; Psalm 119:89). While other books have limited influence on individuals because they are products of finite minds, the Bible has solution to every problem today. No man‟s education is complete if he is ignorant of the provisions of the Bible. No Christian can live successfully without an adequate grasp of the Bible, and no Christian minister is really qualified for the ministry of the Church of Christ without a thorough knowledge of the Bible (II Timothy 2:15). Without a ready knowledge of the Bible, the Christian worker cannot be effective. <br>
                The central theme of the Bible is CHRIST and HIS WORK OF REDEMPTION (John 20:31; Luke 24:25-27; Revelation 1:1). To fully understand the Bible and rightly interpret its message, we must first be converted to Christ and receive Him as Saviour. Those who do not know, or who have wrong conceptions about Christ, cannot appropriately discern the message of the Bible, because the carnal mind cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God (I Corinthians 2:14).

                  <li> <b>THE MINISTRY OF THE BIBLE</b>
                    <p>
                    The Bible reveals God to man, shows him his need of God and the way to Him. It also teaches him, having known God, how to walk with Him and eventually get to heaven. The Bible therefore has a ministry to both sinners and saints. It brings conviction of sin to the sinner, which leads to repentance to God and faith in Christ Jesus (Acts 8:35; 20:20,21). It has numerous functions to the saint. One, it cleanses him and makes him perfect (Psalm 119:9,11; Ephesians 5:26; John 15:3). Two, it is his mirror to reveal the condition of his heart, with the aim to keep him on the narrow way (James 1:23; Hebrews 4:12; Jeremiah 17:9,10; Psalm 19:12). Three, it serves as light to his feet (Psalm 119:105,130). Four, it is his soul‟s food (Deuteronomy 8:3; John 21:17; Psalm 19:10; Matthew 4:4). Five, it is medicine to his body and soul (Proverbs 4:20-22; Psalm 107:20; Matthew 8:8). Six, it is his spiritual weapon (Ephesians 6:17; Matthew 1:1-11; Jeremiah 23:29). Seven, it refreshes and enriches him (Isaiah 55:10; Psalm 19:7-10). And eight, it creates life and faith in him (I Peter 1:23; Rom 10:17).

                    <li> <b>PROFITING FROM THE BIBLE</b>
                        <p>
                        There are some hindrances we need to remove in order to maximally profit from the study of the Bible, such as a hardened heart (Matthew 13:3-6,18-21), double mindedness (James 1:8; Mark 4:15-17), pride (Deuteronomy 8:11-14; Psalm 101:5; Proverbs 18:12) carnality (I Corinthians 3:1-5) and unbelief (Matthew 13:58). Then we need some diligent effort to dig deep and discover the treasures of the Bible and to know Christ more and more (Colossians 2:3; John 5:39). In the first place, there must be earnest love for the truth (Psalm 119:40,47,54,72,103). Secondly, we need supreme love for God (Matthew 22:37; Deuteronomy 30:6; Psalm 73:25). Thirdly, an intense desire to know more of God is essential (Psalm 42:1,2; 63:1). Fourthly, there must be willingness to study (Matthew 13:44-46; 12:42). Fifthly, we need to depend entirely on divine teaching, and be ready to practise what we learn (Psalm 119:60,101,106; James 1:22-25; Ezra 7:10). Sixthly, there must be a fixed purpose to know the whole truth and cultivate a mind that will not be diverted by man or the flesh (Psalm 119:63; 57:7; 108:1; Romans 13:14; Matthew 26:41). Lastly, a life of prayer and a commitment to the whole truth are indispensable. <br>
                        Every believer in the Church can enjoy the provisions of the Bible. But we must be ready to study it with all seriousness, readiness of mind, and with the intention to believe and obey (Acts 17:10-12).
