            <p class="mb-4"> <b>Acts 17:30</b> <br>
                <i>Sin has grave time and eternal consequences (Proverbs 8:36). It incurs the anger or displeasure of God (Psalm 7:11). It enslaves man to satan and the flesh (John 8:34-36; I John 3:8), and brings separation or enmity between man and God (Jos. 7:12; Isaiah 59:2; Rom. 1:24,28). It equally leads to spiritual death, which becomes eternal if one goes unsaved to the grave (Ezekiel 18:4; Rom. 5:12; 6:23). It brings as well guilt, condemnation and judgement (Proverbs 11:21; Rom. 2:8,9; Revelation 20:12-15). And it takes God‟s glory away from man, making his spirit stale, soiled and sterile. Redemption is therefore a necessary requirement if man would ever have fellowship with God.</i> <br>
                The subject of redemption is very crucial in our relationship to God. It connotes the lost and corrupted nature of man that has to be salvaged. It expresses the slavery aspect of our sinfulness. Adam sold mankind to the devil. The lost man is addicted to sin and enslaved to satan. He must be bought back by One who has the legal power to redeem. Fallen man is in bondage and consequently needs freedom. Christ came precisely for this reason to set man free (John 8:32-36). Man is “sold under sin” and sin has dominion over him (Romans 7:14; 6:9-14,22) and his daily cry is “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” (Romans 7:24). Only Christ can truly set free from the captivity of sin (Romans 7:23; John 8:32-36; I John 3:8). Christ came to secure our release. He came to redeem us from sin and His precious blood was the price that He paid to buy us back from the slave market of sin. Through His redemption, we are made free from the bondage and dominion of sin and set at liberty to serve God as free people who walk no more after the flesh but who walk in the Spirit.

              <li id="p1"> <b>SCRIPTURAL DESCRIPTION OF REDEMPTION</b>
                  <p>
                  Ruth 2:20; 3:9-13; 4:1-14; Jeremiah 32:7-16; Leviticus 25:25-28,47-49; Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28; 1 Peter 1:18,19; Revelation 5:9; 14:3,4; Titus 2:14; Galatians 4:4,5.
                  <br><br>
                  Redemption is the deliverance from the power of an alien dominion through the payment of a stipulated ransom and the enjoyment of the resulting freedom. It is a metaphor used in both Old and New Testaments to describe God's merciful and costly action on sinful man's behalf. At the heart of redemption is the payment of a price (a ransom) (Ruth 2:20; 3:9-13; 4:1-14; Jeremiah 32:7-16; Leviticus 25:25-28,47-49; Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28; 1 Peter 1:18,19). From the original Hebrew and Greek words used for redemption, “buying in the market” or “buying out of the market place” is implied. Thus, redemption, as pertaining to salvation from sin, is divine purchase from the slave market of sin. Man is a slave of sin (John 8:33,34) and is particularly said to be “sold under sin” (Rom. 7:14; I Corinthians 12:2; Eph. 2:2,3). This has the meaning of addiction to sin, bondage to sin, dominion by sin (cf. I Kings 21:20,25). There is therefore the necessity of deliverance from this bondage of sin. The process of this deliverance is spoken of as one of redemption – buying us back from the slavery of sin, from the power of an alien dominion (sin) so that sin shall no longer have dominion over us (Romans 6:9-14,22). Redemption thus connotes an exchange – the exchange of a ransom for the subject (Exodus 13:13; Leviticus 27:13,15,19,20,31).
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Some outstanding examples of redemption are recorded especially in the Old Testament:</b>
                  <ol type="I">
                    <li>Israel was redeemed out of Egypt (Exodus 6:5,6; 15:3,13; Psalm 74:2; 77:14,15; 78:42,43; 106:10; 130:7,8; Deuteronomy 14:2; Isaiah 63:4,16; 43:1,3,14-16; 51:10,11; 48:20; Jeremiah 31:11). This is the grand illustration of redemption at its best. God redeemed Israel from Egypt by delivering them from the tyrannous bondage of Pharaoh and placing them in a new land and this was through God‟s mighty hand and power.</li>
                    <li>The firstborn were redeemed by the payment of a ransom (Exodus 13:2,12,13; 21:8; 34:19,20; Leviticus 25:47-49; 27:27; Numbers 3:12,13,41,45-51; 18:15). The payment of the ransom released them from the religious obligation imposed on them at the time of the Exodus. They were thus restored to their families and absolved of the divine claim upon them.</li>
                    <li>Kinsman redemption of property and life (Leviticus 25:23-28,47-49; Ruth 4:4-14; Num. 5:8; I Kings 16:11).</li>
                    <li>A lost estate could be redeemed by a kinsman (Leviticus 25:25). The kinsman was also to take vengeance for a slain relative (Numbers 35:12; Deuteronomy 19:6,12; Joshua 20:3-9).</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p>
                </li>
              
                  <br>
                
                  <li id="p2"> <b>SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS OF THE REDEEMER</b>
                    <p>
                    Ruth 2:20; 3:9-13; 4:1-14; Num. 5:8; Jeremiah 32:7-16; Leviticus 25:25-28; Galatians 4:4,5; I Peter 1:18,19; Mark 10:45; Eph. 1:7; Acts 20:28; John 10:11,15,17,18; Rom. 8:3; 1:3,4; Philippians 2:7,8; John 1:14; Heb. 2:14-18; 9:12,15; 10:4-10.
                    <br><br>
                    In the regulations governing who can be a redeemer especially in the Old Testament, the following qualities or characteristics are basic and Christ perfectly fulfilled them all:
                    <ol type="I">
                      <li>The redeemer must be a near kinsman (Ruth 2:20; 3:9-13; 4:1-14; Num. 5:8; Jeremiah 32:7,8). In order to fulfil this, Christ took upon Himself the form of a man, born of a woman, made under the law that He might redeem them that are under the law (Galatians 4:4,5; Rom. 8:3; 1:3,4; Philippians 2:7,8; John 1:14). By becoming a human being, Christ established His identity with mankind and therefore established His right to act as our redeemer (Heb. 2:14-18).</li>
                      <li>The redeemer must be able to redeem (Ruth 4:1-5; Leviticus 25:25-28). The redeemer must have the wherewithal to make good the debt. He must have the resources to pay the ransom. The price of our redemption has been paid. Christ gave His life a ransom for us (Mark 10:45). His blood was the precious price paid (Acts 20:28; I Peter 1:18,19; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:12,15; Revelation 5:9,10; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; Matthew 26:28).</li>
                      <li>The redeemer must be willing to redeem (Ruth 4:6-11; Jeremiah 32:7-9). The first kinsman, in the case of Ruth, was able to redeem but not willing to redeem before Boaz came into the picture of redeeming Elimelech‟s estate (Ruth 4:1-13). Christ was not only able to redeem, He was also willing to redeem us (Hebrews 10:4-10; John 10:11,15,17,18).</li>
                      <li>Witnesses are required to confirm the redemption (Ruth 4:1-13; Jeremiah 32:7-16). The law required two or three witnesses to confirm a transaction and allowed any other number above this minimum (Num. 35:30; Deut. 17:6,7; 19:15; Matthew 18:16; 26:60; II Corinthians 13:1; I Timothy 5:19; Heb. 10:28). Ten men witnessed the redemption of Elimelech‟s estate by Boaz (Ruth 4:1-13). There were twelve witnesses who confirmed the death, burial, resurrection of Christ our Redeemer and this process of redemption (Acts 1:22; 2:32; 3:15; 4:33; 5:32; 10:39,41).</li>
                      <li>Documentation of the redemption is essential (Jeremiah 32:7-16). A legal document containing the relevant details of the redemptive transaction attests to the fact of the redemption (Jeremiah 32:7-16; Isaiah 8:2). In case of any future misunderstanding, this legal document will be proof that the redemption did take place. The New Testament is our legal document confirming the redemption in Christ.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li id="p3"> <b>SPIRITUAL BENEFITS TO THE REDEEMED</b>
                        <p>
                        Redemption has a far-reaching consequence on the beneficiary. The New Testament redemption through the blood of Jesus brings the believer into a new relationship with God. The following benefits accrue to everyone who believes in Christ:
                        <ol type="I">
                          <li>
                            <b>Remission</b> (Matthew 26:28; Acts 10:42,43; 13:38,39). Remission means to send off or send away, to separate the sin from the sinner. It is forgiveness following the execution of penalty (Leviticus 4:35; Heb. 9:22). Forgiveness is on the basis of Christ‟s atoning sacrifice (I John 1:6-9; 2:2). Where there is remission for sin, the sinner can go in peace without any adverse eternal consequence.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Reconciliation</b> (Rom. 5:10,11; 11:15; II Corinthians 5:18-20; Eph. 2:13,16; Colossians 1:20,21). The sinful world has always been in enmity with God. Christ‟s sacrifice provided the ground whereby a sinner could be brought back into fellowship with God. Thus, every redeemed soul is restored into friendship with God.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Regeneration</b> (Titus 3:5; John 3:3-8). The sinner is dead in sins and trespasses. Regeneration is the supernatural, re-creative work of the Spirit of God in the sinner‟s heart, whereby he is endowed with spiritual life and a renewed disposition to God and His word. To regenerate is to be beget again (John 1:13; 3:3-8), to create (Eph 2:10), to make a new creature (II Corinthians 5:17), to make a new man (Eph. 4:24), to quicken or give life to (Eph. 2:1,5), or to bring forth (James 1:18). Regeneration is purely God‟s work. It is the imputation of divine life, which makes us able to enter God‟s Kingdom. Man is passive in this experience. It is the Spirit of God that effects this spiritual resurrection, making man responsive to the Word of God and the call to salvation.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Justification</b> (Rom. 3:24,28-30; 4:5; 5:1; II Corinthians 5:21). The atoning blood of Jesus justifies the believer. To justify is to declare righteous. The justified sinner stands before God as if he never sinned. Justification is a divine reckoning. It is a legal act, which effects no moral change.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                          <b>Translation</b> (Colossians 1:12,13; Acts 26:18; Eph. 5:5). Our redemption is followed by translation from satan‟s kingdom and power into the Kingdom of God. The redeemed soul should no longer remain under the yoke or bondage of the enemy; he should occupy his rightful position with the saints. He was once darkness, but now, he is light (Matthew 5:14-16).
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Adoption</b> (Galatians 4:4-7; 3:25-29; Eph. 2:19). Being redeemed, we come into a new relationship with God – that of Father and son. The Spirit of God comes into us, and we cry, “Abba, Father.” Just like every child has access to the father in the natural, so also does the redeemed have access with boldness into the presence of God (Heb. 4:16; 10:19-22).
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <b>Exaltation</b> (Eph. 2:4-7,10; I Pet. 2:9,10; Revelation 1:5,6). The redeemed occupies an exalted position in heaven – far above principalities and powers. He becomes God's workmanship. As an ambassador of God, he engages in the ministry of reconciliation. He is made a priest and a king unto God.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <p>The redeemed position has untold benefits. God is still calling all who are outside His redemptive plan. The door of grace is still open, and all who sincerely come shall enter and find security (Revelation 3:20).</p>
                        </ol>
