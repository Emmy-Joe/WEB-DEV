            <p class="mb-4"><b>Isaiah 9:6,7</b><br>
              <b>God’s Word teaches that Christ’s Millennial Reign is the 1000 years literal reign of Jesus on earth, which will be ushered in by the coming of Jesus back to earth with ten thousands of His saints. At this time He will judge the nations that dwell upon the face of the earth (Jude 14,15; II Thessalonians 1:7-10). During this time the devil will be bound (Revelation 20:2,3). It will be a reign of peace and blessing (Isaiah 11:6-9; Hosea 2:18; Zech. 14:9-20; Isaiah 2:2-4).</b>
              <p>The word millennium is a compound derivative from Latin which simply translates into a thousand years. Thus, Christ‟s millennial reign is a thousand years of the full manifestation of the glory of God. It is sequel to the Great Tribulation which is a period of intense suffering for all on earth</p>
              <p>According to God‟s revealed timetable, the Church will suddenly be taken away by Christ (I Thessalonians 4:13-18) in a mysterious event known as the Rapture. Then will follow seven years of great suffering of sinners left behind (Matthew 24:21-22). At the end of this period, Jesus will come again with the Church to establish His government (Jude 14). The government of this world, at that time, will resist His coming. But the Lord will overcome at the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 19:15-21). Satan will be bound and imprisoned for 1000 years (Revelation 20:1-3). The kingdom of this world will then become the kingdom of our God and His Christ (Revelation 11:15; Daniel 2:44).</p>

                <p>
                Christ‟s millennial reign will be a time when the purposes of God will be fully realised on earth, as a theocracy (government of the state under the firm control and direction of God) will be established. Christ, as the divine Representative of the Godhead will at this time, speak and act for God. He will be given a universal and glorious dominion, with absolute power to govern (Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 45:4; Isaiah 11:4; Psalm 72:4). It will be the responsibility of Christ at this age to announce God‟s will and law (Isaiah 2:3,4; 33:21,22; 42:4; Acts 3:22). The millennial reign will be a manifestation of the promise God gave David, that his throne would have no end. Christ, as David‟s Son after the flesh, will thus establish a glorious house and throne, over an equally glorious kingdom (II Samuel 7:12-16; Psalm 72; Isaiah 11:10). Divine mercy, divine goodness and divine truth will be displayed through Christ even as the glory associated with His deity, omniscience, omnipotence and righteousness will be fully made manifest.
                <p>The Gentile world system (humanity without Christ) as it is at present organised under the direct influence of satan, will thus become an outmoded setup. In its stead comes Christ‟s millennial reign void of sin and all forms of unrighteousness. Satan, having been defeated and bound, will lack the power to induce people to sin (Revelation 20:1-6; Matthew 19:28; Ephesians 5:25-27).</p>

                    <p>
                    What are the components of the millennium? <b>One</b>, the millennium shall witness an unprecedented era of national and individual peace. There will be a complete cessation of the scourge of wars, as the kingdoms of the world will be fused together under the reign of Christ. The ensuing peace will herald an era of economic boom and prosperity. The beauty of this age is that hitherto antagonistic and irreconcilable foes will henceforth co-habit as “sheep and lambs.” <br><b>Two</b>, there will be joy unspeakable (Isaiah 9:3,4; Jeremiah 30:18,19). <br><b>Three</b>, there will be holiness (Ezekiel 43:7-12; Isaiah 1:26,27). <br><b>Four</b>, there will be glory (Isaiah 24:23; 60:1-9). <br><b>Five</b>, there will be comfort (Isaiah 12:1-2; Jeremiah 3:23-25). <b>Six</b>, justice will abound (Isaiah 9:7; 11:5; 42:1-4). <b>Seven</b>, there will be full knowledge (Isaiah 11:1-2,9; 41:19-20; 54:13; Habakkuk. 2:14). Additionally, the following benefits will also accrue to the inhabitants of the age. <b>One</b>, the original curse placed upon mankind at creation will be removed, resulting in abundant productivity to the earth (Isaiah 11:6-9; 35:9; 65:25). <b>Two</b>, sickness becomes a thing of the past (Isaiah 33:24; Jeremiah 30:17; Ezekiel 34:16). And <b>three</b>, healing will naturally be available to the deformed (Isaiah 29:17-19). Against the background of the above, there shall be preservation of life (Isaiah 41:8-14; 62:8,9; Jeremiah 32:27; Ezekiel 34:27; Joel 3:16-17; Amos 9:15; Zech. 14:10,11), and complete freedom from all forms of oppression that at present ravage mankind (Isaiah 14:3-6; 42:6,7; 49:8,9; Zech. 9:11,12).

                        <p>
                        Who are those expected to partake in Christ's millennial reign? <b>One</b>, the glorious Church (Ephesians 5:25-27). This will exclude the apostate church that is married to the world (Revelation 17:1-7). <b>Two</b>, the poor in spirit (Matthew 5:3). These are those who recognise and admit their state of spiritual poverty (life on earth without assurance of salvation) and are willing to turn away from sin and surrender to Christ. And <b>three</b>, the watchful, prayerful saints (Hebrews 9:28; Matthew 25:34).
