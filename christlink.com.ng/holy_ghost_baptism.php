            <p class="mb-4"><b>Acts 1:8</b><br>
              <b>God’s Word teaches that the Baptism in the Holy Ghost is the enduement of power from on high upon the sanctified believer. It is the promise of the Father and when one receives this gift of the Holy Ghost, it is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking a language unlearned previously, referred to as “speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance” (Matthew 3:11; Acts 1:8; Luke 3:16; 24:49; John 1:30-33; 7:37-39; 14:16,17,26; 15:26; 16:12-15; Acts 1:5-8; Mark 16:17; Acts 2:1-18; 10:44-46; 19:1-6). We do not teach or instruct people how to speak in tongues: the Holy Spirit gives utterance. We also stress the necessity of Purity before Power. The gifts of the Spirit are for today (I Corinthians 12:1-31; 14:1-40).</b>
              <p>The baptism in the Holy Ghost is central to the New Testament dispensation. This experience is crucial to the fulfilment of the life and ministry of both the individual believer and the corporate body. The Early Church emphasized the necessity of being filled with the Holy Ghost (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8; 2:38; 4:31; 9:17; 10:38, 44; 19:2,6; Eph 5:18).</p>

                <p>
                The Holy Spirit is not a mere impersonal force. He is not a mere power that we can get hold of and use. He is not a mere influence that we feel. He is a Person Who seeks to get hold of us and use us. The Holy Spirit is a Divine Personality Whom we must honour, worship, fellowship with and listen to. He is called the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Living God, the Spirit if Christ, the Spirit of Holiness, the Spirit of Life, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of your Father, the Comforter, the Eternal Spirit (Matthew 28:19; II Corinthians 13:14; Luke 11:13; Hebrews 9:14; I Corinthians 3:16; II Corinthians 3:3; I Peter 1:11; 4:14; Romans 1:4; 8:2; Matthew 10:20). The Holy Ghost is eternal, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient and holy. He is Inspirer of the Holy Scriptures, the general Overseer of the militant Church, the great Teacher, Comforter, Helper and Guide of all saints. He is the character Builder of all members of Christ‟s Body (Hebrews 9:14; Psalm 139:7-10; Acts 10:38; Matthew 12:28; Luke 11:20-22; I Corinthians 2:10,11; John 14:17-26; II Corinthians 3:18; Galatians 5:22,23). He is the third Person of the holy Trinity (I Corinthians 8:6; Ephesians 4:3-6; Matthew 28:19).

                    There are many things the Holy Spirit does in, for, and through the believer, the Church, and in the world. One, He searches all hearts (John 16:8-11; I Corinthians 2:10,11). Two, He convicts of sin (John 16:7-11). Three, He regenerates (Titus 3:5). Four, He bears witness with us (Romans 8:14-16). Five, He adopts into God‟s family (Romans 8:15). Six, He helps and gives victory in temptation (Romans 8:2,26,27). Seven, He aids us in prayer (Romans 8:26,27; Zech. 12:10). Eight, He fills believers with joy, peace and boldness (Acts 13:49-52). Nine, He sanctifies (Romans 1:4; 5:5). Ten, He quickens and heals our body (Romans 8:11). Eleven, He comforts, counsels and commands (Isaiah 11:1,2). Twelve, He intercedes for the saints (Romans 8:26,27). Thirteen, He illuminates and inspires (II Peter 1:21). Fourteen, He searches and reveals the deep things of God (I Corinthians 2:9-12). Fifteen, He teaches (John 14:26). Sixteen, He guides into all truth (John 16:13). Seventeen, He creates (Psalm 104:30). Eighteen, He empowers (Acts 1:8). Nineteen, He directs the Gospel work (Acts 8:26-29; 16:6-10). And twenty, He confirms the Gospel (Hebrews 2:3,4).

                        The baptism in the Holy Ghost is the endowment of power from on High upon the sanctified believer. It is the promise of the Father and when one receives this gift, it is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking a language unlearned previously, referred to as “speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance” (Matthew 3:11; Acts 1:8; John 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:30-33; 7:37). This language is not humanly, but divinely taught (Acts 2:4). Jesus Christ the great Teacher preached it and promised it (John 7:37-39; Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:4-8).
                        <p>The Baptism with the Holy Ghost is not the new birth, salvation, conversion or regeneration (John 7:37-39; 14:17; 17:6-9,14-16 Luke 10:19-24; 24:49). It is not the sanctification experience (John 17:9; 17:21-23, and Acts 2:1-4). Jesus prayed for the sanctification of His disciples and yet commanded them to wait for the enduement of power - the Baptism with the Holy Spirit. Moreover, sanctification is for purity whereas the Baptism with the Holy Spirit is for power. It is also not illumination, joy, feeling, liberty and victory in prayer, self-denial or zeal (Luke 24:27,31-32,44-45; Acts 8:8,14-17; Matthew 19:27; 16:17).</p>

                        <p>
                        The mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit is promised to all flesh, and those who meet God‟s condition will receive God‟s abundance (Isaiah 44:3; Ezekiel 36:25-27; Joel 2:28,29; John 7:37-39). Very few of Old Testament saints had the bulk of the Spirit upon them for some special tasks the Lord gave them to do. But there were prophecies of a better time when the Holy Spirit would be poured on God‟s people in an overflowing measure (Isaiah 44:3; Joel 2:28,29). Inasmuch as prophecies concerning Christ‟s incarnation, birth, life, dominion, rejection, suffering, meekness, death and resurrection have been fulfilled, so also must all prophecies concerning the outpouring of the Holy Spirit be fulfilled (Num. 23:19). There are steps we need to take to be baptized in the Holy Ghost. One, we must strongly desire or thirst for the experience (Isaiah 44:3; John 7:37,39). Two, we must first receive “a new heart” or be sanctified (Ezekiel 36:26,27). Three, there must be faith to receive (Galatians 3:2,14; Mark 11:22,24). And four, we must pray sincerely and earnestly for the experience (Luke 11:13).
