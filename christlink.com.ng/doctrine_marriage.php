                        <b><i> God’s Word teaches that marriage is binding for life. Monogamy is the uniform teaching of the Bible. Polygamy is contrary to God’s perfect will and institution. Also, under the New Testament dispensation, no one has a right to divorce and remarry while the first companion lives. When a person becomes converted, necessary restitution, on this line, must be done without delay if he has married wrongly (Genesis 2:24; Deuteronomy 7:1-4; Job 23:11-13; II Corinthians 6:14-18; Proverbs 30:10-31; Mal. 2:14; Romans 7:2,3; Ephesians 5:31-33; Matthew 5:31,32; 19:3-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18; John 4:15-19; Genesis 20:3-7). </i></b>

                                Marriage is a holy union, a living symbol, a precious relationship that needs tender self sacrificing care. It is God‟s idea and not a derivative of any culture. <b>It is a gift from God to man and it has three basic aspects. One, the man leaves his parents, and in a public act, pledges himself to his wife. Two, the man and woman are joined together by taking responsibility for each other‟s welfare and by loving the partner above all others. And three, the two become one flesh in the intimacy and commitment to the wonderful union which is reserved for marriage. By so doing, marriage provides needed fellowship, comfort, companionship and partnership.</b> With very few exceptions, most men and women are to marry. These few exceptions are to receive God's guidance; it should be no product of infantile decision, misguided imitation, faithless consecration or religious compulsion (Genesis 2:18-20 22-24; Matthew 19:3-9; Ephesians 5:31; I Corinthians 7:1,2,25-29,32).

                            <p>
                                As marriage is God's institution and order, <b>believers should depend on Him to lead them to the appropriate partner, rather than to resolve to worldly methods like "sampling" or "picking and choosing".</b> <i>“And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him” (Genesis 2:18). God seems to be saying, “I am not going to allow the man to choose for himself” (Genesis 2:22).</i> “And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto him”. Also, God did not bring a girl, an immature person, or a teenager to the man, but a woman - intelligible, sensible and mature. He brought a perfect fit - two of a kind! <b>God still leads His children to His will even today.</b> He does this through His Word (Psalm 119:105,130; II Timothy 3:16,17), the inner voice of the Holy Spirit, prompting, directing, influencing or checking (John 10:4,5,27; Romans 8:14; Proverbs 20:27; I Samuel 9:15-21; 16:13; Joel 2:28,29; Acts 9:10-15). However, any revelation that is received must be diligently compared with the scripture. If any revelation, visions or dreams contradict the scripture in any way, such are to be rejected as false (Isaiah 8:19-20; Jeremiah 23:21-32; II Corinthians 11:13-15; Revelation 22:18-19). Moreover, once the will of God is known, believers are to seek and obtain their parent's consent before going on with any further plans (Genesis 24:15-29; 34:3-12; Exodus 22:16; Deuteronomy 7:3; I Samuel 18:20-21; I Corinthians 7:36-38).

                        <li id="p3"> <b>IMPORTANT MILESTONES ON THE MARRIAGE JOURNEY</b>
                            <p>
                                Before the wedding is conducted, some necessary procedures must be finalised. One, the parents‟ consent must be sought, as mentioned above. It is ungodly for any believer to elope with a woman or man no matter the divergent and unyielding stance of their parents (Genesis 31:20-29). People in such a situation must pray and trust in the Lord who gave the revelation of His will, to finish the work, for “with God all things are possible” (Psalm 37:4; Philippians 4:6; Proverbs 21:1; Mark 10:27). Two, parents‟ consent leads to a period of courtship to be determined by the church leadership, but preferably not longer than nine months. This affords the intending couple the opportunity to understand each other and plan for the future together. It is a time to be spent together not in secrecy but in the home of a Christian family where movement of people is not restricted. It is during courtship that the intending couple will discuss their expectations of each other (on finance, size of family anticipated, extended family relations, etc). Purity must be maintained before, during and after the courtship (I Thessalonians 4:3-7; 5:22). Undue familiarity and exchange of gifts at this stage are not acceptable. Three, payment of bride price or “dowry” shall be executed in line with the scriptures. It is an ungodly practice to borrow money or go into debt to impress the woman‟s parents or invitees. It is also considered sinful for two people to live together without meeting the requisite obligations to their parents (Exodus 22:17; I Samuel 18:25-27; Hosea 3:2,3; I Corinthians 14:40; Romans 13:7-8). Four, the Christian wedding is preceded by filing in of notice at the Marriage Registry according to the prevailing law.
                            <p>And five, The Church wedding takes place after the pastor has received proof from the local council. The church will not join (i) a couple in marriage where one of them had been previously married and is separated from his or her partner (Matthew 19:4-6), (ii) a lady who has not obtained the consent of her parents, (iii) a couple in an unequal yoke; that is, one of them is not born again (Deuteronomy 7:3; II Corinthians 6:14), (iv) a lady who is already pregnant. Therefore no believer will marry an unbeliever or a divorced person. Moreover, God‟s word forbids marriage between relatives (Leviticus 18:6). Marrying relatives was prohibited by God for physical, social, and moral reasons. Children born to near relatives may experience serious health problems. When improper sexual relations begin, family life is destroyed. “For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled” (Leviticus 18:29). From the parables and actual marriages in the scripture, wedding times were moments of rejoicing and feasting (Jeremiah 16:8,9; 33:11; John 2:1-11; 3:29; Isaiah 62:5) and special garments were provided for the bridegroom, bride, and guests at the wedding (Matthew 22:12; Revelation 19:7,8). Yet, Christian practice must be guided by the uniform teaching of Christian living in the New Testament (I Corinthians 7:29-31; 6:12; 9,13; Romans 14:15; I John 2:6; 3:2-4). The believers therefore must shun every form of worldliness and worldly imitations in dressing and the in the manner of entertaining guests. Simplicity and modesty must characterize the wedding and God‟s name glorified.</p>

                        <li id="p4"> <b>FOUNDATION FOR A STABLE HOME</b>
                            <p>
                                The first step in creating a new union with one‟s spouse is the dissolving of the old one – severance of relationship with one‟s parents (Genesis 2:23,24; Ephesians 5:30,31). The man is to leave father and mother, which means departing, losing oneself, finding freedom from something. Many who have violated this scriptural principle have discovered to their surprise a hurt to their marital joy. Marriage is until death do us part and God did not make provision for divorce or re-marriage. Secondly, lack of spiritual, emotional and intellectual intimacy usually precedes a breakdown of physical intimacy. When couples fail to expose their secret thoughts to each other, they shut off the line of communication. The great secret of conjugal happiness is mutual love, kindness, tenderness, loveliness of character in the home. Thirdly, the wife should respect and obey the husband and the husband should love and care for the wife (Ephesians 5:22-31). “Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord”. Submission is not the erasure of the woman‟s personality. It is neither subjugation nor an imposed obedience. Submission is a voluntary subordination. It is obedience motivated by love (Philippians 2:5-8). “Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands…” (I Peter 3:1-6). Such a life speaks loudly and clearly, and it is often the most effective way to influence a family member. Christian wives should develop inner beauty rather than being overly concerned about their appearance. When the wife lives the Christian faith quietly and consistently in the home, her family will see Christ in her.
                            <p>“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it . . . so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself” (Ephesians 5:25-28). Christ is the model of love. The husband can never love his wife too much, yet that love is inconsequential, compared to his love for the Lord. The husband‟s love makes him to be considerate, understanding and is able to bear with his wife. The husband is also the head of the family. This headship has the idea of authority, and authority after the analogy of Christ‟s Headship. In that sense, the husband is the spiritual head of the family and his wife goes along with his leadership. A wise and Christ-honouring husband will not take advantage of his role, and a wise and Christ-honouring wife will not try to undermine her husband‟s leadership.</p> <br>
                            <p><b> “Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband” (Ephesians 5:33). </b></p>
