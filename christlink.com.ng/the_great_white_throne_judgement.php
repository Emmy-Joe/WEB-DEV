            <p class="mb-4"><b>Revelation 20:11-15</b><br>
              <b>God’s Word teaches that the Great White Throne Judgment is when God finally judges all (the living and the dead, small and great) who have ever lived on the face of the earth, according to their works. This is after the Millennium. At this time the final judgment will be held. All those from all ages, who have not yet been judged (believers’ judgment, as sinners, was accomplished by Christ on the cross - John 5:24; 3;17-19) will stand before God at this time. The devil and his angels are judged at this time also and sent to the lake of fire forever (Daniel 12:2,3; Matthew 10:15; 11:21-24; 12:41,42; John 5:28,29; Romans 2:5-9,12,16; 14:12; II Peter 2:9; Jude 6; I Corinthians 6:1-4; Acts 10:42; Revelation 20:11-15).</b>
              <p>In this teaching on the events of the last days or eschatology, the Lord is graciously unveiling the curtain of eternity to reveal to humanity His programme for this present evil world. The doctrine of The Great White Throne Judgment opens our eyes to see a time to come when all wicked/ungodly people (the living and the dead, small and great who have neglected God‟s salvation) will face the final judgment of the Living God (Romans 14:12). We caution that the teaching must not be approached with doubtful disputations or viewed as fable or fiction but a fact. These are true sayings of God written for our learning and admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come (Romans 15:4; I Corinthians 10:11; Revelation 19:9).</p>

                <p>
                The Bible clearly presents the order of events preceding the Great White Throne Judgment and constantly enjoins, “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches” (Revelation 2:7). At the close of the millennium, the devil will be released from “the bottomless pit” (Revelation 20:3), and he will deceive thousands of people and gather them to fight against the King (Christ) and His saints. This is the battle of Gog and Magog. But at the end of the battle, when the rebellious have been killed and destroyed by the fire of His indignation which comes down from heaven, the devil will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10). After this, Great White Throne Judgment will be set. God will sit on a throne so white, magnificent and terrible that the whole earth and (atmospheric) heaven will tremble and flee from Him. All those who died unrepentant from the time of Adam till the time of this judgment will be resurrected (Daniel 12:2; John 5:28,29; Acts 24:15) This is called the second resurrection. And they will all stand before God to account for their deeds. This final judgment of sinners (the living and the dead, small and great) is known as the Great White Throne Judgment (Psalm 9:17; Daniel 7:9-10; Matthew 11:20-24; 10:15; John 5:28-29; Revelation 20:11-15). The Bible is replete with pointers to this great and notable day of the Lord (Ecclesiastes 12:14; Matthew 11:21-24; 12:41,42; Romans 2:15,16; II Peter 2:9; Jude 14,15; I John 4:17).

                    <p>
                    The world is corrupt and polluted. Man is rebellious and disobedient against God. Right from the beginning, God sighed for the acts of man, “for every imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart has been evil continually” (Genesis 6:5,6). But this will not continue forever. No! for “He hath appointed A DAY in which He will judge the world righteousness” (Acts 17:30,31). But everyone whose name is written in the Book of Life will escape the Great White Throne Judgment, since his judgment as a sinner was borne by Christ on the Cross (John 3:17-19,30; Romans 8:1; John 5:24). Besides, “God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ” (I Thessalonians 5:9). “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death” (Revelation 21:8). That great congregation will consist of (i) all categories of sinners (dead of alive) from Adam to date. They will be judged for neglecting the salvation of God (Hebrews 2:3); (ii) all backsliders in all dispensations (Exodus 32:33); (iii) all who deny the deity of Jesus Christ (John 3:18,36). These are the sceptics, the atheists, idol worshippers and all people who neither depend on Christ‟s atonement as the final sacrifice for sin nor accept His Lordship; (iv) all religious hypocrites who “...are like unto white sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness” (Matthew 23:27).

                        <p>
                        Death has been an invidious age-long enemy of God‟s creation. It is Satan‟s principal messenger of destruction and instrument of cruelty. At the Great White Throne Judgment, death will be stripped of its power, and cast into the lake fire. Consequently, there shall be no more death (Revelation 20:14; I Corinthians 15:26). Hell, the temporal abode of the souls of the wicked, will likewise be emptied and cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14). This old earth which has been polluted with sin, defiled by Satan, demons and sinners shall be burnt up (II Peter 3:10). The heavens (atmospheric heavens or skies) which have similarly been polluted by Satan and wicked spirits shall be dissolved and “the elements thereof shall melt with fervent heat” (II Peter 3:7,10-12). God will judge (a) all unrighteous deeds of men (I John 5:17; Romans 11:28-32) - every unrighteous act, feeling or imagination that was not cleansed by the blood of the Lambs will be condemned at the Great White Throne Judgment; (b) the secret deeds of men (Matthew 10:26; Romans 2:16; Hebrews 4:13; II Chronicles 16:9) - every secret bribery, immorality, pornography, drunkenness, abortion, etc, will be revealed. “And the books (of record) were opened, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works.” There is a record in heaven for everything done under the sun, “whether it be good or bad” (I Corinthians 5:10b); (c) the words of men (Matthew 12:36,37; 5;22; Ephesians 4:29,31; 5:4). “Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” Every gossip, backbiting and slander against our neighbours, fellow believers or church leaders, will be judged.
                        <p>All foolish, unedifying, corrupt, graceless and abusive words against others will be accounted for at the Great White Throne Judgment. “For by they words thou shalt be justified and by they words thou shalt be condemned” (Matthew 12:37). God will judge every unrepentant sinner or backslider (Proverbs 11:21). God‟s judgment will be fair, without partiality or respect of persons (Romans 2:2-12; Job 34:18-22). He will judge the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the educated and the illiterate, the highly respected and the most despised. “For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh rewards (bribe)” (Deuteronomy 10:17). The righteous Judge of the universe will receive no bribe to pervert judgment on that great day. But “in righteousness He doth judge and make war” (Revelation 19:11). God is without partiality. “WHOSOEVER was NOT found WRITTEN in the BOOK OF LIFE was cast into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).</p>
                        The lake of fire is a place of indescribable suffering and punishment for all those who shall be condemned at the Great White Throne Judgment. The punishment of the wicked will be grievous, comfortless and endless in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. “And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night” (Revelation 14:11). <b>Escape through Christ’s grace!</b>
