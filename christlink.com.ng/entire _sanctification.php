              <b>God’s Word teaches that Entire Sanctification is a definite act of God’s grace, subsequent to the New Birth, by which the believer’s heart is purified and made holy. It cannot be attained progressively by works, struggle or suppression, but it is obtained by faith in the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ. Holiness of life and purity of heart are central to Christian living (Luke 1:74,75; John 17:15-17; 1 Thessalonians 4:3,7,8; 5:22-24; Ephesians 5:25-27; Hebrews 2:11; 10:10,14; 13:11,12; Titus 2:11-14 ; 1 John 1:7; Hebrews 12:14; 1 Peter 1:14-16).</b>
                <p>The doctrine of entire sanctification is central in the mind of the Godhead. The doctrine is at the hub or nucleus of Christian teaching. What then is the meaning of the word, Sanctification? Sanctification is an English word which means: to make sacred or holy; to set apart for a holy or a religious use; to make free from sin; to cleanse from moral corruption and pollution. It is the act of God‟s grace by which the affections of men are purified or separated from sin and the world and exalted to supreme love to God. It is to purify in order to prepare for divine service and for partaking of holy things; to free from the power of sin; to be set free from the power of cancelled sin. It is a gracious work of the Holy Spirit, not of works, not of growth, not of death, not of purgatory. God has the ability to destroy sin. Sanctification is an operation of the Spirit of God on those who are already in Christ. They who are effectually called and regenerated having a new heart and a new spirit created in them need to be further sanctified through the virtue of Christ‟s death and resurrection, His Word and His Spirit.</p>

                Sanctification is an instantaneous experience given to a believer to enable him cleave to God without the tendency to want to go astray or away from the Lord. You do not grow INTO sanctification, but you can grow IN sanctification. Again, sanctification is not brought about by death. To assume that is to say that death is no longer our last enemy to be destroyed (I Corinthians 15:26). Neither are we cleansed from the original stain (the nature we brought into the world) through Water Baptism. It is also not of works, but it is the work of God, divinely wrought by the Holy Sprit. “Holiness”, “Perfection” and “Sanctification” are the definitive terms used interchangeably. Holiness means entire freedom from sin; wholeness, spiritual health, moral integrity and purity. As our bodily health means the absence of sickness, so also does holiness mean the absence of sin (Luke 1:74,75; Psalm 29:2; 93:5; 1 Pet. 1:16; Hebrews 12:14). “Perfection” means that which is not lacking in that which it ought to have. The perfection which God requires and accomplishes in those who earnestly ask in faith is the purifying of our hearts; loving every believer as Christ loves us and loving our neighbours as ourselves. Nothing less than this is desirable and nothing more is required (Colossians 1:28). Entire sanctification is described as “clean heart” or “pure heart” (Psalm 24:3-4; Matthew 5:8). The Bible teaches that all of God‟s children can be like Jesus in separation from the world, in purity and in love. A blameless life is a life in which God sees nothing to condemn. We may not be blameless to our contemporaries, but we can be blameless before God. When God examines a sanctified heart, He finds all that he possesses to be in harmony with Himself. His heart is a throne on which God reigns without a rival; an empire wherein He exercises unchecked, undisputed dominion and authority.

                    How does the earnest seeker get sanctified? On the one hand, there must be a definite separation and withdrawal from all sins and appearance of evil (I Thessalonians 5:22; II Corinthians 6:17); from immorality and all unclean things (II Timothy 2:21). And on the other hand, there must be ENTIRE Consecration. This is giving ourselves unto God in a vivid manner; first, we give ALL we are to God. Here we no longer lay any claim on ourselves (Luke 9:60; Romans 12:1-2). Second, we give our body unto the glory of God, not for any selfish motive or purpose in view, but with the consideration and knowledge that we are bought by the precious blood of Jesus. Third, we give OURSELVES FOR SERVICE (John 13:12-17). We should not stress our being priests and kings unto God but as being servants. Here Jesus shows how to consecrate and dedicate ourselves for service. Washing the feet was the work of a slave. So, we must learn to do the meanest job in the midst of believers and not waiting for compliments. Fourth, we must die to self. “Verily, verily I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit” (John 12:24-26). Consecration is coming before God with our past, present, future, personality, possession, wisdom, talent, intellect, money, influence, position in the family and in the church and dedicating all to God. Having been so separated and dedicated unto God, God will then be ready to do His part and give us a definite experience which is Entire Sanctification. This is the operation of God, a definite act of God‟s grace in believers‟ hearts (Hebrews 2:11; 13:12,13).

                        <p>
                        God has provided His Word, His Blood, His Faith, His Spirit and Himself as free gift for sanctification (John 15:3; Hebrews 13:12,13; Acts 26:18; I Thessalonians 2:23). It is God‟s perfect will that we be sanctified (I Thessalonians 4:3-8; I John 5:14,15). This holiness does something in our hearts that will make us live right. We must desire it and pray fervently in faith for it (Mark 11:24). The experience can be kept by abiding in Christ, watching and praying (John 15:4; Mark 13:32-35). We should not grieve the Holy Spirit, relapse into bitterness or harshness of spirit, unprofitable conversation, unkind criticism, evil speaking, faultfinding, self indulgence, prejudice,impatience, indolence, negligence, self management or showing interest in objects of temptation (Ephesians 4:30,31; 5:3,4).
