            <p class="mb-4"> <b>Matthew 24:15-22</b> <br>
                <i>God’s Word teaches that the Great Tribulation will occur after the Rapture; it will be a time of terrible suffering on earth. It is also referred to as the time of “Jacob’s trouble” (Matthew 24:21,22,29; Revelation 9:1-6; Mark 13:19; II Thessalonians 2:3-10; Revelation 13). During this time, the Antichrist will take possession of this world for a reign of terror. He will not be a system or organization but a person - a supernatural, diabolical being, in the form of a man who will blaspheme and proclaim himself to be God (Daniel 8:23-25; II Thessalonians 2:7-12; Revelation 13:1-10). The Marriage Supper of the Lamb will take place above while the tribulation continues on earth (Revelation 19:1-10).</i> <br>
                The great tribulation is described as the “time of Jacob‟s trouble” (Jeremiah 30:7-9) “... great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world nor ever shall be” (Matthew 24:21); “...the day of the Lord” (Joel 1:15); “a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness” (Joel 2:1,2); “... wasteness and desolation” (Zephaniah 1:14-18); “... a time of trouble” (Daniel 12:1). The purpose of the great tribulation is to make Israel suffer so that they can be ready to cry to the Messiah (the Lord Jesus Christ Whom they at present reject) to come back to them. It is also to judge the unbelieving men and women of all ages (Zech. 12:10,11; 13:1-9; 14:12,13).

              <li id="p1"> <b>THE TIMING OF THE GREAT TRIBULATION</b>
                <p>
                The Bible shows that the great tribulation will take off after the rapture of the Church, and will last for seven years. It will end at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ when He alights on Mount Olives (Zech. 14:4; Matthew 25:31; II Thessalonians 1:7-10; Jude 14,15; Acts 1:11). At this time He will settle on earth (Jerusalem) for a thousand-year reign called the Millennium (Revelation 20:4,6). This means that the great tribulation is between the Rapture and the Millennium. That is, it is during the 70th or last of Daniel‟s 70 weeks (Daniel 9:26,27; Matthew 24:15-31; II Thessalonians 2:3-8). It is after the Rapture because God will not like His children to suffer the great tribulation, its judgments and destructions. He saved Noah (a preacher of righteousness) and his family before destroying the world with flood (Genesis 6:8-10; 7:1-13,16-24; 8:15-22). He rescued Lot (who was vexed with the filthy conversation of Sodom) and his family before destroying Sodom and Gomorrah with fire (Genesis 19:10-29; II Peter 2:4-9). So God will take away His children from the earth before the great tribulation begins. The great tribulation reaches its peak of destructions, judgements, terrors, frightening wars and desolation from the middle of the 7 year duration and ends with Christ‟s Second Advent. This is when the Antichrist breaks his 7 year peace covenant with Israel and attacks Jerusalem (Matthew 24:15-22; Daniel 12:1; Jeremiah 30:6-9).

                  <li id="p2"> <b>EVENTS AROUND THE GREAT TRIBULATION</b>
                    <p>
                    The great tribulation is described as being full of woes, judgements, famines, bloody wars, explosions, plagues, terror, men calling for mountains to fall upon them, anguish, earthquakes, burning rocks falling from heaven upon the earth and scorching it, seas polluted, cattle and vegetation destroyed, millions dying from catastrophes, “as if a man flees from a lion and bear meet him ... he leans on the wall and the serpent bites him.” Beasts and men will be in trouble; even mighty men will weep. “Neither their gold and silver (riches) will be able to deliver them.” Whole cities and nations will be under great distress, perplexity, seas and waves roaring, hypertension, and confusion as the powers of the heavens are shaken by God (Amos 5:18,19; Isaiah 2:19-21; 24:1-3,6,19; Mark 13:24; Joel 1:15; Luke 21:25,26; Matthew 24:11-26; Revelation 19:1-21). The great tribulation opens with the rapture of the church. Then comes the rise of the Antichrist (II Thessalonians 1:7,8). He will win nations, some by war while others concede authority to him (Daniel 7:8,24-25; Revelation 17:8-14). The “false prophet” popularizes him, making men to worship even his image. No one buys or sells without the mark or number (6-6-6) of the beast (Revelation 13:1-18; 14:9-11). While these go on, saints receive rewards in Heaven (Revelation 2:17,25-28; 3:12). There will be great apostasy, more of false religions and increase in the power of the devil who will be driven down to the earth (II Thessalonians 2:3-12; Revelation 12:10-12; 13:2,12-18). God‟s planned judgements will fall on men in a divine sequence producing supernatural phenomena and demonic creatures unknown to man. These will come as Christ opens seven seals of a scroll on which they occur, then the blowing of 7 trumpets each a harbinger of more woes. 144,000 Jews will be sealed and raptured as well as countless tribulation saints from all over the world (Revelation 7:1-17). Saints in tribulation will be martyred (Revelation 6:9-11; 14:13; 20:4-6). A mighty angel appears with rainbow on his hand, a little book opened and swears that “there should be time no longer” (Revelation 10:1-11). After this the high point of catastrophes called “the great tribulation” begins for the remaining 3½ years (Revelation 11:1-19; Daniel 12:1-7; Jeremiah 30:6,7). Jerusalem falls to the Antichrist, and Israel is defeated (Matthew 24:15-22; Daniel 11:40-45). Israel runs for refuge in old Edom (Revelation 12:6,13-17; Isaiah 16:1-5). There will be more woes of the earth through the pouring out on it of the seven vials (Revelation 15:1-6; 16:21; 18:1-24). God‟s two witnesses will appear, be killed and later resurrect (Revelation 11:1-12). The marriage supper of the Lamb takes place (Revelation 19:1-10), and saints prepare to return to earth with Christ (Jude 14,15; Revelation 19:11).
                    <p>The scope of the tribulation will cover Israel, the Middle East and the whole earth. The powers at work will be (a) The Antichrist called Beast, king of the north, the Syrian, the Assyrian, the king of Babylon, the Extortioner, the man of sin, the little horn, the prince that shall come, a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sayings, the spoiler, the son of perdition, and that wicked one empowered specially by satan (II Thessalonians 2:1-10; Daniel 7:8,24; 8:9,23; 9:26,27; 11:36-45; Revelation 13:1-18;1 4:9-11; Isaiah 10:20-27; 30:18-33; Micah 5:3-15; Isaiah 14:4; 16:4; Daniel 7:11), (b) The False Prophet (Revelation 13:1-19; 14:9-11; 19:20), (c) God’s powerful judgments (Joel 1:15; 2:12; Amos 5:18; Rev 4:1 - 19:21), and (d) The devil (Revelation 12:7-17; 20:1,2; II Thessalonians 2:9).</p>

                        <p>
                          While terrors are unleashed on the earth, the saints will be (a) receiving rewards (I Corinthians 3:11-15; Luke 14:14; I Corinthians 9:24-27), (b) Rejoicing and feasting (Revelation 19:6-9), (c) Worshipping God with the angels (Revelation 7:9-17; 14:1-5; 4:5,7), and (d) preparing for the second Advent with Christ upon white horses (Jude 14,15; Revelation 19:11-14; Matthew 25:31). After the great tribulation, Jesus will come back to the earth to establish His millennial reign. Then Israel will repent and be saved (Zech. 14:1-8; Micah 1:3,4; Romans 11:25-27; Hebrews 8:8-12; Isaiah 66:7,8). When Jesus Christ comes, He will destroy the Antichrist and the false prophet, and cast them into the lake of fire, while destroying their armies at the battle of Armageddon (valley of Megiddo). Then an angel will bind the devil and cast him into the bottomless pit for a period of one thousand years (Ezekiel 38-39; Revelation 20:1-3; 19:11-21).
