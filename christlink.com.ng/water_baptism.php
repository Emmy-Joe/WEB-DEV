            <p class="mb-4"> <b>Matthew 28:19; Acts 8:35-39</b> <br>
              <b>God’s Word teaches that Water Baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with God. Water Baptism is one immersion (not three), “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”, as Jesus commanded (Matthew 28:19; 3:13-17; Mark 16:15,16; Acts 2:38; 8:38,39; 19:1-6; Romans 6:4,5).</b>
              <p>Water Baptism is one of the two ordinances in the New Testament. The second is the Lord‟s Supper. Water Baptism is compulsory for every believer in the Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16). It symbolises, to the believer, identification with, and partaking of Christ‟s death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3,4). When we submit to water baptism, it is an acknowledgment of Christ in a public way. Therefore it is a ceremony that witnesses to all that one has put on Christ (Galatians 3:27). It is the commandment of Christ which everyone who loves Him must keep (John 14:15). Our obedience to the Gospel is not complete without Water Baptism.</p>

              <li id="p1"> <b>BEFORE WATER BAPTISM</b>
              <p class="mb-4"> Acts 8:35-37</p>
                <p>
                Matt. 3:5-8; Luke 3:10-14; Acts 2:41; 19:4,5,18,19; 16:30-33 <br>
                Genuine repentance of sins, and the exercise of the saving faith in Christ, are prerequisite to water baptism (Acts 20:20,21). Repentance has evident fruits which include confession of sin, the amendment of our past evil deeds, and a sincere determination not to go back into them any more (Proverbs 28:13; Ezekiel 33:15,16). As we believe then on the name of Christ, our sins are forgiven, and our names are written in the Book of Life (I John 1:9; Luke 10:20). It is only then that we are eligible for Water Baptism. Definitely, a baby who is not conscious of right or wrong cannot possibly repent of sin and maintain any saving faith towards Christ; hence infant Baptism is essentially unscriptural. Furthermore, it is not Water Baptism that saves us, as some people erroneously teach. Without a good conscience, an observance of this ordinance avails nothing (I Peter 3:21).

                  <li id="p2"> <b>DURING WATER BAPTISM</b>
                  <p>Acts 8:38,39</p>
                    <p>
                    Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:5,10; John 3:23; Matt. 18:19,20 <br>
                      In the first place, it is essential that the he who will baptise another be born again. It is unfortunate when the “minister” himself is a sinner (Matthew 15:14; 23:16; Luke 6:39). Secondly Water Baptism is by immersion, not by sprinkling or pouring water or making a cross on the forehead by water. The meaning of the word itself is very clear. “Baptism” is not an original English word; in fact the Greek word, baptiso, was not translated at all, it was only anglicised. To baptise is the same as to “dip”, “soak”, “drench”, “immerse”, etc. That is why “much water” is necessary, and it was possible for the candidates to come “out of the water”. Thirdly, it is only one immersion, not three! Jesus died only once. And lastly, it must be done “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 28:19). Some people teach that it must be done in the name of Jesus only. But this is not scriptural. We must follow the format specified by the Lord Himself, which the apostles did not change (I Corinthians 15:3; Galatians 1:6-9).

                    <p class="mb-4">Acts 8:38,39</p>
                        <p>
                        Acts 16:32-34; Romans 6:3-13; Galatians 3:26,27; Colossians 2:10-12 <br>
                        “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in the newness of life.” After we are baptised, we should walk in newness of life. The old life thereby buried must not be revived again.
                        <p>Our faith in Christ has been publicly declared and confirmed. There are witnesses, not only on the earth, but also in heaven. In fact, the devil knows that he has lost us once we are baptised unto Christ. Therefore we must remain in subjection to Christ.</p>
                        Every convert is enjoined to yield to this important ordinance. Pastors must do their best to encourage their flock to attach great importance to this practice (Acts 20:28). Apostle Peter encouraged his hearers to “repent and be baptised every one of you…” As we surrender ourselves to the ordinance, the blessings of obedience will surely follow us (Isaiah 1:19; John 13:17).
